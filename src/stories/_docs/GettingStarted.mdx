## Prerequisites

Before installing, make sure your project meets the following requirements:

- **Node.js** ≥ 18
- **React** ^18.2.0 and **react-dom** ^18.2.0 (peer dependencies — must be installed separately)

## Installation

```bash
npm install @a_ng_d/figmug-ui
# or
yarn add @a_ng_d/figmug-ui
```

## Basic usage

Import the component and its styles from the package:

```tsx
import Button from '@a_ng_d/figmug-ui/components/actions/button/Button'
```

Apply a theme by setting `data-theme` and `data-mode` attributes on the root element:

```tsx
document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-theme', 'figma')
document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-mode', 'figma-dark')
```

Available values:

- **`data-theme`** — `figma` · `penpot` · `sketch` · `framer`
- **`data-mode`** — `figma-light` · `figma-dark` · `figjam` · `penpot-light` · `penpot-dark` · `sketch-light` · `sketch-dark` · `framer-light` · `framer-dark`

## What's in the docs

The documentation is organized by component category. For each component you will find:

- **Usage** — available props and when to use each variant
- **Accessibility** — WCAG 2.2 guidance (roles, keyboard, ARIA attributes)
- **Dos & Don'ts** _(coming soon)_ — illustrated good and bad practices with live component previews

## Figma library

The Figmug UI Figma component library is **coming soon** — it will include all components with their variants, tokens, and annotations mapped to this documentation.

Once available, you will be able to enable it directly in your Figma workspace under **Assets → Team libraries**.

## What's in the docs

Each component page includes two perspectives:

- **Usage (Design)** — guidance on choosing variants, sizing, spacing, and composition rules
- **Dos & Don'ts** _(coming soon)_ — side-by-side visual examples showing correct and incorrect usage patterns, built from the real Figma components

## Themes

The library supports four platforms, each with light and dark modes:

- **Figma** — Figma UI (light + dark + FigJam)
- **Penpot** — Penpot UI (light + dark)
- **Sketch** — Sketch UI (light + dark)
- **Framer** — Framer UI (light + dark)

Use the **UI Theme** and **Color Mode** toolbar controls at the top of any story to preview components in the target environment.
